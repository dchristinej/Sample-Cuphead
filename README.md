# My take on creating a sample website. Inspired by the Cuphead Game site.

Build a web page that match the following requirements: <br>
a. The page should have the following components: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Navigation</li>
  <li>Content</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
</ul>
b. The page should be responsive following the “mobile first”
approach <br>
c. The styles should be written using a CSS preprocessor like
SASS or LESS <br>
d. Expanded navigation on desktop that transforms into sandwich
menu on tablet and mobile <br>
e. Build a “Back” button which appears when scroll 50% of the
page <br>
i. Write a custom JS code using Vanilla JavaScript which
scrolls to the top when the “Back” button is clicked <br>
f. Build a responsive carousel using external JS library and show:
<ul>
  <li>3 items for desktop and tablet</li>
  <li> item for mobile</li>
</ul>
<br>
g. Build a “Load more” button that fetch image URL from an
external API endpoint and add it to the carousel (you can use
jQuery & The Cat API)

<i> I will not be creating (g) since i have yet to learn about it and the syntax around it. I dont want to create something on my site that I can't atleast explain. </i>
